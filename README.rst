My notes and code from reading `The Fascinating World of Graph Theory`
(Benjamin, Chartrand & Zhang).

Definitions
----------

A *graph* `G` is a collection of *vertices*, *nodes*, or *points*; 
and *edges*, *arcs*,  or *lines* where two vertices are joined by an edge 
if they are related in some way.

A *complete graph* of order `N` (represented K\ :sub:`N`\ ) is a graph of `N` 
vertices with every two vertices joined by an edge.
